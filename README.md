## Introduction

The purpose of this work is to explore the construction of neural networks, particularly the multilayer perceptron, from the perspective of functional programming, with the intention of increasing understanding about them.

Due to the presence of function libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow, Python is the preferred language by the majority for the development of areas that involve Artificial Intelligence algorithms. According to an [article from Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/top-programming-languages-for-ai-engineers-in-2020-33a9f16a80b0), approximately 57% of developers choose Python or C++ to address solutions in the area of AI. Although these languages allow for rapid development, I believe that these libraries are not ideal as an introduction to the theoretical topics on which neural networks are based. In my personal experience, they create 'knowledge gaps.' Their utility is evident, but as an educational tool, they may have their disadvantages.

This project has evaluated students' difficulties with the multilayer perceptron algorithm and, after finishing the functional implementation, it evaluates whether this approach could enhance undersanding.
